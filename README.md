# LEAD-SCORE

_Developed a sophisticated lead-scoring model powered by machine learning algorithms to enhance sales efficiency. The model leverages customer behavior, demographics, and historical sales data to predict the likelihood of lead conversion. By assigning lead scores, the model enables businesses to prioritize high-potential leads, optimizing resource allocation and improving conversion rates. This machine learning-driven approach streamlines lead management, increases sales team productivity, and drives revenue growth._
